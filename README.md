The theme for GNU/Linux system for Hyprland. 

FH: I take a nice red colors for the first time. Usually have dark blue or violete. 

How install theme ? 
 - I think you have a experience how move and change in linux. 
 - (Juno-red-ocean) move to your .theme (if don`t exists just create in home directory) and use gsetting. In README inside directory have the command for gsetting.
 - (waybar) rename old directory waybar in .config to oldWaybar (if you had) and move my waybar to .config.
 - (hypr) rename old directory hyrpland in .config to oldHypr (if you had) and move my hypr to .config.
 - (background) create directory "wallpapers" in Pictures and move only file or save a file in custom way (don`t forget change hyprpaper.conf).

Knowed issue list:
  
  1) Is color area of mouse selection. (I don`t found in code where change to red, so is dark ocean green)
